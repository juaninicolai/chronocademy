- Implement Skills Page
  - convert page to use tabs component (teaching vs  teaching skills)
  - initialize initial signup state as null to prevent pages from being accessible if not going through flow
  - do backend stuff (database schemas, apis or form actions and mark skills to teach / learn and wire up on frontend)

Nice to Have:

- Validate sign up form on change less often (Check debounce)
- Handle unexpected signup action error
- Display /api/auth/signin on /signin
