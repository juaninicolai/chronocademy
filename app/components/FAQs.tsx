                        Chronocademy is an online platform that allows users to exchange skills using a time-based
                        currency
                        called Chrono. Users can earn Chrono by teaching skills they are proficient in and spend Chrono
                        to learn new skills from others.
                        Chronocademy addresses a critical gap in the education market by providing an accessible,
                        flexible,
                        and cost-effective way for people to learn and share knowledge. The platform's time-based
                        currency ensures that everyone has an equal opportunity to teach and learn, regardless of their
                        financial situation.

                        The price of a class is set by the teacher and it will depend on different factors, such as

                        only
                        through the platform chat. If a class is booked directly through the calendar, the price will be
                        the one set by default by the teacher.
